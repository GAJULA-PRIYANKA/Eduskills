        "This Applied Business Analytics project, titled *Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning*, focuses on solving the critical business problem of customer attrition. The objective is to identify the main drivers behind churn and develop a predictive model that enables the company to take proactive measures to retain customers. The scope of the project is limited to analyzing internal customer transaction and demographic data collected over the past three years, while external market data is excluded to maintain focus and feasibility. The methodology involves collecting and cleaning data, handling missing values, and preparing features for analysis. Techniques such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, logistic regression, and random forest are applied using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. The findings reveal that churn is strongly linked to low engagement frequency, and the predictive model achieves an accuracy of 85% in identifying at-risk customers. High-value customers also display distinct churn patterns compared to low-value customers, offering deeper insights into customer behavior. The business impact of this project is significant, as it enables the company to design targeted retention strategies that could reduce churn by 10%, translating into potential annual savings of $2 million. In conclusion, the project demonstrates how applied analytics can transform raw data into actionable intelligence, providing measurable business value. Future work may involve integrating external market trends and developing real-time monitoring systems to further enhance predictive capabilities.\n",

        "To help a client achieve a business objective, the first step is to ensure the objective is clearly defined and measurable, such as increasing revenue, reducing costs, or improving customer satisfaction. Once the goal is established, the client should analyze the current situation by gathering data, identifying gaps, and understanding the challenges that stand in the way of success. Based on this analysis, strategies can be developed that directly align with the objective—for example, enhancing marketing efforts to boost sales, streamlining operations to cut costs, or improving customer service to reduce churn. These strategies must then be translated into actionable plans with clear responsibilities, timelines, and resources. Implementation should be followed by continuous monitoring using key performance indicators to measure progress. If results deviate from expectations, adjustments should be made to optimize performance. In essence, the client is advised to combine clear goal-setting, data-driven insights, actionable strategies, and ongoing evaluation to transform objectives into measurable outcomes.
